<P>
Network of Byteland consists of <i>n</i> servers, connected by <i>m</i> 
optical cables. Each cable connects two servers and can transmit
data in both directions. Two servers of 
the network are especially important --- they are connected to 
global world network and president palace network respectively.
</P>
<P>
The server connected to the president palace network has number <i>1</i>, and 
the server connected to the global world network has number <i>n</i>.
</P>
<P>
Recently the company <em>Max Traffic</em> has decided to take
control over some cables so that it could see what data is
transmitted by the president palace users. Of course they 
want to control such set of cables, that it is impossible to
download any data from the global network to the president palace
without transmitting it over at least one of the cables from the set.
</P>
<P>
To put its plans into practice the company needs to buy 
corresponding cables from their current owners. Each cable has some
cost. Since the company's main business is not spying, but
providing internet connection to home users, its management wants to 
make the operation a good investment. So it wants to buy such
a set of cables, that cables <em>mean cost</em>} is minimal possible.
</P>
<P>
That is, if the company buys <i>k</i> cables of the total cost <i>c</i>, 
it wants to minimize the value of <i>c/k</i>.
</P>
<H2>Input</H2>

There are several test cases in the input. The first line of each case contains <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> 
(<i>2 &lt;= n &lt;= 100</i> , <i>1 &lt;= m &lt;= 400</i> ). Next <i>m</i> lines describe
cables~--- each cable is described with three integer numbers:
servers it connects and the cost of the cable. Cost of each cable
is positive and does not exceed <i>10<sup>7</sup></i>.
</P>
<P>
Any two servers are connected by at most one cable. No
cable connects a server to itself.
The network is guaranteed to be connected, it is possible
to transmit data from any server to any other one.
</P>
There is an empty line between each cases.
<H2>Output</H2>

First output <i>k</i> --- the number of cables to buy. After that
output the cables to buy themselves. Cables are numbered starting
from one in order they are given in the input file.
There should an empty line between each cases.
